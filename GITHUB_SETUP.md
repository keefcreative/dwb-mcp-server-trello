# üöÄ GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

1. **Git Repository Initialized** - Local Git repo is ready
2. **Health Check Endpoint** - Working on port 3001
3. **Environment Variables** - dotenv support added
4. **Deployment Configs** - Ready for Render, Railway, and Fly.io
5. **Documentation** - Complete integration and deployment guides

## üéØ Next Steps: Create GitHub Repository

Since GitHub CLI is not installed, you'll need to create the repository manually:

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon ‚Üí "New repository"
3. Repository name: `dwb-mcp-server-trello`
4. Description: `Custom MCP server for Trello board automation and client onboarding`
5. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dwb-mcp-server-trello.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Repository

- Check that all files are uploaded
- Verify the README.md displays correctly
- Confirm deployment configs are in the `deployment/` folder

## üîß Local Testing Commands

```bash
# Build the project
pnpm run build

# Start the server (requires valid Trello credentials in .env)
pnpm run start

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","version":"0.1.0","uptime":...,"service":"dwb-trello-mcp"}
```

## üìù Environment Variables Needed

Before using the MCP server with real Trello integration, update `.env` with:

```env
TRELLO_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
TRELLO_TOKEN=your-actual-token
TRELLO_BOARD_ID=your-actual-board-id
TRELLO_ORG_ID=your-actual-org-id
```

Get these from:
- API Key: https://trello.com/app-key
- Token: Use the authorization URL from the main README.md

## üöÄ Ready for Integration

Once the GitHub repository is created, you can:

1. **Start MCP Client Integration** - Follow `MCP_CLIENT_INTEGRATION.md`
2. **Choose Deployment Platform** - Review `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md`
3. **Test with Real Credentials** - Update .env and test board creation

## üìö Documentation Files

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `MCP_CLIENT_INTEGRATION.md` - Website integration guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md` - Production deployment options
- `GITHUB_SETUP.md` - This file
