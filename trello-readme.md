# 🧾 README: How to Use Your Trello Board

Welcome to your **1-board request system**! This Trello board is your personal dashboard for submitting design requests, tracking progress, reviewing work, and collaborating with our team — all in one place.

It’s directly connected to our internal system to power automations, personalized responses, and AI-powered features.

## 🗂️ How the Board Works

Your board is organized to move each request through clear stages:

| **List**            | **What It’s For**                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🟢 **New Request**   | Submit new work by checking a box in the **Request Launcher** or adding a new card. |
| 📥 **Queue**         | Approved and ready-to-go requests, waiting to be picked up.                        |
| 🛠 **In Progress**    | We’re actively working on these requests.                                          |
| 🧐 **Review**         | Items ready for your feedback and approval.                                        |
| ✅ **Completed**      | Final work — no action needed.                                                     |

## ✍️ How to Submit a Request

### Option 1: **Use the Request Launcher** ✅  
- At the top of the board, find the card titled:  
  **🟢 Start a New Request – Select a Type Below**
- Check the box that matches what you need (e.g. Social Post, Email Design)
- A new request card will be auto-created with a form to fill in

### Option 2: **Add a Card Manually**  
1. Go to the **New Request** list  
2. Click **"Add a card"** and give it a clear title  
3. Open the card and:
   - Fill in the brief details  
   - Attach any images, documents, or links  
   - Add a **Due Date** if you have a deadline

Once submitted, our system will:
- Acknowledge your request via email  
- Prepare it internally  
- Move it to the **Queue** once approved
